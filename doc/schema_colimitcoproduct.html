----------------------------------
schema_colimit (coproduct : t)
	</pre>
quotient <schema> + ... + <schema> : <typeside> constructs a colimit of schemas as a quotient of a co-product.  Each schema must be a variable, whose name will serve as a prefix for attributes and foreign keys in the resulting colimit schema.  For this reason, the variable names must be distinct.  The entities of the resulting colimit schema are canonicalized strings describing equivalence classes of source entities.
Each entity equation has the form  v_1.e_1 = v_2.e_2 , where  v_1, v_2  are schema names and  e_1, e_2  are entities in  v_1, v_2 , respectively.
Each path equation has the form  <path>=<path>, where the foreign keys in each path have the form  v_fk , where  v  is a schema name and  fk  is a foreign key in  v .  Note that the underscore used here is different than the period used in the preceding section; this discrepancy is required for CQL to have an unambiguous grammar.
Each observation equation has the form  forall x. <term> = <term>, where the symbols in each term have the form  v_f(\ldots) , where  v  is a schema name and  f  is a symbol in  v .   Alternatively, equations of the form  \forall x. \ p(x) = q(x) , where  p,q  are paths, can simply be written as  p = q .  When there are no equations this keyword is printed as coproduct rather than quotient.<br/><br/>Appears in:<br/><br/>
