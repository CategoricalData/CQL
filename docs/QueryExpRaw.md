A query literal, known informally as an uber-flower.  Equivalent to a co-span of mapping, and generalizes relational conjunctive queries to multiple target tables with foreign keys. If Q is from S to T, then for each entity t in T we have a from where query or so-called frozen S instance Q(t).  Furthermore, for each foreign key fk taking e1 to e2 Q(fk) is a tranform from Q(e2) to Q(e1), i.e., contravariantly.  Similarly, each attribute att from e to t has a corresponding transform Q(att) from the representable instance y_t to Q(e).  See All_Syntax for an example.
