Imports a SQL database onto an autogenerated CQL schema.  The CQL schema will have one attribute per column in the input DB, and one foreign key per foreign key in the input DB, and equations capturing the input DB's foreign key constraints.  The type side will have a single type, ``dom''.  When the [jdbcclass] and [jdbcuri] are the empty string, their values will be determined by the  jdbc_default_class and  jdbc_default_string options.  See also option  import_col_seperator and schema_only (imports the empty instance).  See also  prepend_entity_on_ids and jdbc_no_distinct_unsafe.
