Imports a transform from a JDBC database, one two-column SQL query per entity. The first column is interpreted as the source and the second column as the target.When the [class] and [jdbc string] are the empty string, their values will be determined by the  jdbc_default_class and  jdbc_default_string options.  The  map_nulls_arbitrarily_unsafe option can be used to automatically map labelled nulls during import.
