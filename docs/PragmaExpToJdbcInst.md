Emit an instance (on SQL type side) over a JDBC connection, one table per entity with one column per foreign key and attribute.  There will be a table prefixed by each entity en.  The columns will be the attributes and foreign keys whose domain is en , and an ID column whose name is set in options.  CQL rows that are not syntactically constants will be exported as NULL.  When the [jdbcclass] and [jdbcuri] are the empty string, their values will be determined by the  jdbc_default_class and jdbc_default_string options.  See start_ids_at and id_column_name and varchar_length.
