An instance obtained from a JDBC connection, one SQL query per entity.  The SQL code for each entity should return a table with an ID column and one column per attribute/foreign key from that table.  Note that these tables must be complete: this keyword imports a model (set of tables) of a schema, not a presentation of a model of a schema (i.e., as  literal does).  To import an instance as a theory, use the  import_as_theory option.  When the [jdbcclass] and [jdbcuri] are the empty string, their values will be determined by the  jdbc_default_class and  jdbc_default_string options.  See also import_missing_is_empty.
