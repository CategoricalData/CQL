## Type Side

Generally the typeside defines the way CQL kinds connect to a computational environment. This
particular typeside is limited to a string type used to display human readable labels and
descriptions. More generally, CQL type sides can be much more complex supporting such things as
functions that can be called in line to enhance the definition of schemas as well as queries. Such
considerations are beyond the scope of this demonstration.

## Spans

A span is a shape (graph) LeftFoot <- Head -> RightFoot. In the context of a schema where the
objects are entities and the arrows are foreign keys, a span implements a many to many relationship.
In these two examples we are modeling first the relationship between medications and patients and
second the relationship between adverse events and patients. These two schemas illustrate how CQL
implements the two typs of arrows, foreign keys (entity -> entity) and attributes (entity -> type).

## Instance

Instances for each of the three schemas above. CQL instances differ from SQL instances in that
primary keys which provide a unique identifier for a record are replaced with generators. A
generator plays a more active role than an identifier they serve to generate records even in the 
absense of data. This happens through the process of saturation. During the process of saturation
if data is missing (either foreign key values or literals) a typed null value is added that is
typed by the generator and the column where the value occures.

## Colimit

Construct the schema colimit by first adding the three schemas disjointly and then taking the
quotient. Taking the quotient means that some combination of entities and foreign keys are declared
to be equal. Intuitively the colimit is a construction that assembles a schema from a set of input
schemas that overlap according to the quotient. Entities and foreign keys declared equal define the
overlap.
" *) }
schema_colimit PAM_Assembly = quotient
	sPatientMed + sPatientAE + sCausality : tString {
    entity_equations
      sPatientMed.Patient = sPatientAE.Patient
}

md { (* "
---

## Deconstructing the colimit

This block of code is added for pedigogical reasons. The colimit is an object composed of a schema
together with a set of mappings, one associated with each of the source schemas. We provide each
such feature with a name for clarity in the remaining blocks of code.
" *) }
schema sPAM_Assembly = getSchema PAM_Assembly
mapping mPMtoPAM = getMapping PAM_Assembly sPatientMed
mapping mPAtoPAM = getMapping PAM_Assembly sPatientAE
mapping mCtoPAM = getMapping PAM_Assembly sCausality

md { (* "
---

## Migrating data using sigma

Having assembled the desired target schema we must now move the instance data associated with the
source schemas. Sigma is a CQL kind that moves instance data through the mappings created by the 
colimit. The syntax takes one such schema mapping together with an instance associated with the 
source schema and produces an instance in the target schema.
" *) }

instance iPMinPAM_Asmbly = sigma mPMtoPAM iPatientMed
instance iPAinPAM_Asmbly = sigma mPAtoPAM iPatientAE
instance iCinPAM_Asmbly = sigma mCtoPAM iCausality

md { (* "
---

## Adding instances

The coproduct construction is also sometimes called a sum. The relational analog is union distinct.
The effect of this construction is to disjointly combine the sepperate instances produced by sigma
in the previous step into a single instance.

instance iPAM_Asmbly_Sum = coproduct iPMinPAM_Asmbly + iPAinPAM_Asmbly + iCinPAM_Asmbly : sPAM_Assembly


md { (* "
---

## Merging data

As in the case of the schema merge produced by the colimit above we now need to identify records
that are duplicates of one another and merge those records. The quotient query provides a mechanism
for identifying duplicates based on matching attribute values identified using the query syntax.
In this case we are assuming the program name is a natural key for programs. The quotient query is 
analogous to the colimit quotient used above for merging schemas at the entity level.
" *) }
instance iPAM_Asmbly = quotient_query iPAM_Asmbly_Sum {
	entity
		Patient -> {
			from
				p1:Patient p2:Patient
			where
				p1.PA_Patient_Name = p2.PM_Patient_Name}
}

md { (* "

## Adding constraints

Constraints can be added using the query construction. The process begins with the definition of 
the target schema that has the desired constraints.

schema sPAM_Norm = literal : tString {
	entities
		Medication PatientMed Patient PatientAE
		AdverseEvent PAM Causality
	foreign_keys

		PAM_C : PAM -> Causality

		Preferred_Term : AdverseEvent -> String	
		Causal_Cat : Causality -> String

## CQL query

A CQL query differs from a relational query in that the result of the query is a schema rather than
a single table. As such, CQL can verify that the query definition is 'structure preserving'. This
means that the movement of data from the source schema to the target schema is done in a way that
ensures the data integrety of the source schema is faithfully enforced by the query mapping. This
verification of structure preservation takes place when the query is compiled. 

A broad view of the CQL query construction reveals that a CQL query generalizes a SQL query in that
each entity block is analogous to a SQL query. That is, the assembly of a single target entity 
is analogous to a SQL query but for the addition of the foreign keys block. The foreign keys block
provides a mechanism (described below) for construction of outgoing foreign keys. Such foreign keys
are in fact columns of the entity being defined and so CQL extends SQL by knitting together multiple
target entities with foreign keys. In this way a CQL query preserves the structure of the source
schema in constructing the target schema.

Another feature provided by the query construction is the creation of foreign keys. In this case
we are constructing foreign keys from the PAM entity to PatientAE and PatientMed entities. This is
implemented using a strategy that is equivalent to the SQL join. A join is an equationally defined
subset of a Cartesian product. In this specific case, we equate the three attribute values of the
PAM entity, each a path from the PAM entity to the string type, with a path starting from the target
entity and ending with the string type containing a matching attribute value. To this we add a third
equation that enforces the commutitive diagram defined in the target schema.

The population of the foreign key column involves assigning the target generator of the target
entity blocks where the two target entities are constructed (PatientAE and PatientMed) to the
corresponding target generator in the source entity block (PAM). For the mapping of existing foreign 
key column (AE_Causality) we assign the target entity generator from the block where that entity is 
constructed.

The remaining blocks are identity mappings.

## Migrate data

The CQL query construction generalizes the sigma data migration construction as follows. Sigma is
functional in that it is many to one. That is, sigma migrates data from many source entities into 
a single target entity. The query construction acts like a generalized relation which can map many
source entities into many target entities. The movement of an instance is emplemented by the
application of the eval keyword. Eval takes a query and applies it to an instance of the source
schema and produces an instance of the target schema.

## Denormalization using a CQL query

Our next application of a CQL query illustrates how we can construct a bus architecture where we
have collapsed the normalized schema above into a set of star schemas with conforming dimensions.
This effecively constructs a bus architecture using a single query. The schema below defines the
target we wish to construct consisting of three facts and three dimensions. The PAM facts reference
all three dimensions while the PatientAE and PatientMed facts reference the patient dimension along
with the AdverseEvent and Medication dimensions respectively.
